A few months ago I was invited by the [SINF - Semana de Informática](https://www.sinf.pt/) (Informatics Week) organization team to organize and develop the challenges for their annual Programming Contest.

A bit of context: **SINF** is an event organized by students for students, that takes place every year at FEUP, the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto, which aims to provide tech-related content and first-hand contact with tech companies to college students. The event has been organized by [NIAEFEUP](https://ni.fe.up.pt/) in the past 3 editions.

Although I've been a member of the organization team of this event in the past 2 editions, I was quite glad to take on a different role this time. This was my first time ever organizing a Programming Competition and creating new original problems, which was quite an interesting challenge! However, I must add that I got a lot of help from my friend [Guilherme Silva](https://github.com/GuilhermeJSilva/), which not only was my beta tester but who also gave me a lot of feedback regarding how to structure and improve the problems. I would also like to thank Professor [André Restivo](https://web.fe.up.pt/~arestivo/page/) for taking the time to review the problem statements.

The contest was held from the 8th to the 11th of November 2020 and featured a total of 6 original problems, which were released in pairs throughout the 3 days of competition. A total of 66 people from different parts of the country signed in and, in the end, a total of 5 people were able to solve all the problems!

The problems were organized in a sort-of-ascending-difficulty-manner, and their main theme was to help the organization team solve problems that required the help of programming! Each of them was assigned a score based on its difficulty:

- **Scheduling the First Meeting** - 100 points (Easy), 88.89% success rate
- **Minimizing Costs** - 275 points (Medium), 60.87% success rate
- **So many speakers** - 150 points (Easy), 75% success rate
- **Grouping lecture themes** - 250 points (Medium), 94.12% success rate
- **Organizing the workshop** - 250 points (Medium), 73.33% success rate
- **Time to celebrate** - 350 points (Hard), 41.67% success rate

More details about the competition can be found on the [contest's Hackerrank page](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/sinf-2020-programming-contest/challenges).

Since doing it by hand would be not only a nightmare but also not reusable in the future, I developed a set of scripts to generate all the inputs and outputs. All of this and my proposed solutions for the problems can be found in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/xRuiAlves/SINF-2020-Programming-Competition).

I must say it was a lot of fun to get out of my comfort zone and accept this challenge and, for once, to be on the creating side of competitive programming. I hope I get the chance to do it again in the future!

Cheers!
