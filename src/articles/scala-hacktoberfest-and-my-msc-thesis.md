## Learning Scala and Competitive Programming

For a couple of months now, I've been wanting to learn `Scala`. I wanted to pick up something in the functional programming spectrum, and Scala seemed like a very good choice (lots of support and documentation, cute syntax, ...). I was quickly amazed at how clean and tidy scala code looks. Moreover, I was pretty happy with the fact I could start by coding more OOP-java-like code (which is what I'm used to) and slowly pivot towards the functional side.

Right at the same time, I found out about [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/) (which is way too addictive incidentally) and start spitting out some cool one-liner solutions to the easier exercises while I got acquainted with the language. I also re-started [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019/), which has a few nice problems that were cool to learn some new Scala concepts.

On another note, I decided to drop LeetCode's daily challenges, since most of them are repeated and/or a bit too easy. I guess I might come back to them during the next month's challenges if I start to miss them :stuck_out_tongue:

All in all, Scala seems to be pretty powerful and has a lot of ways of getting the same task done. As time goes by, I want to pivot towards the functional side of the scala spectrum as much as possible, since it was what got me into it in the first place.

## Hacktoberfest

This year was my second time participating in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), an open to everyone month-long celebration of open source software that takes place every year during the month of October. 

Last year I decided to contribute to [tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) and joined two local Porto hubs to hack alongside other people, which was pretty cool (I also won a pair of [Sammy the Shark plush slippers](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DbGA9NmWkAAm0if.jpg) that I am actually wearing right now).

However, in 2020's edition my participation was fully remote (due to the current pandemic situation) and was more focused in contributing to some projects from [FEUP's Computer Engineering Student Branch](https://github.com/NIAEFEUP) (in which I've been a member of the board for 2 years and member for almost 5 years now). Earlier in October, I was aiming to contribute to [Lichess](https://github.com/lichess-org), a free and open-source internet chess server. However, since most of their services run in Scala, I didn't feel quite ready to dive into their codebase (which was another motivation for wanting to learn Scala!).

## MSc Thesis: Automated API Refactoring for Edge Computing

As part of my last year in the [Computer Engineering MSc](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/cur_geral.cur_view?pv_curso_id=742), I am now working on my MSc thesis and dissertation, under the mentorship and guidance of Professor [Tiago Boldt Sousa](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/func_geral.formview?p_codigo=479881). I will be working towards implementing a web framework capable of self-inspection and self-organization, with the capacity of moving parts of its own API from cloud to edge computing, and vice-versa. 

I am quite happy with this topic, as it is a great opportunity to learn more about serverless computing models, as well as cloud and edge computing paradigms. Looking forward to investigating more about these subjects!

The [SINF 2020 Programming Contest](https://www.hackerrank.com/sinf-2020-programming-contest/) (the first programming contest I've developed by myself) is starting tomorrow and will be up and running for 3 days, with new originals challenges every day! I'm planning to write a bit about it (and maybe discuss some of the problems) in the near future.

Cheers!
